  <title>HPE Helion 1.1 Development Platform: Management Console</title>
  <body>
    <p>The Management Console is a web interface for Application Lifecycle Service (ALS). Using the
      same API as the Helion CLI client, it provides access to a subset of features for deploying,
      scaling, and configuring applications as well as monitoring quota usage, and viewing logs.</p>
    <p>The interface differs for Admin and non-Admin users. End-users should review the <xref

        Guide</xref>.</p>
