  <title>HPE Helion Development Platform Installation Prerequisites</title> 
  <body>
    <section id="prerequisites"> <title>Prerequisites</title> 
      <p>The HPE Helion Development Platform is installed in the overcloud of HPE Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm></p>
      <note>Helion OpenStack version 1.1.1 is <b>required</b> for Helion Development Platform 1.3.
        Installing Helion Development Platform on previous versions of HPE Helion OpenStack is not
        supported. If you currently have a version of the Helion Development Platform installed on HPE Helion OpenStack version 1.1, <xref href="../devplatform_upgrade.dita">follow the upgrade procedures</xref>.</note>
      <p>Before you begin installation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The Cinder block storage service must be configured with either <xref href="../../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.-vsa-overview.dita" >VSA</xref> or <xref href="../../../commercial/GA1/1.1commercial.install-3par.dita" >3Par</xref>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If you installed HPE Helion OpenStack with <b>KVM</b> hypervisor support, configure HPE StoreVirtual VSA for Block Storage or configure HPE 3PAR StoreServ Storage.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The system running the installer needs to have Python 2.7. Most modern operating systems include this as part of their base toolkit. This document is geared toward a Linux operating system but this does not preclude the installer from running on other operating systems with some minor modifications to the command-line statements.</p>
