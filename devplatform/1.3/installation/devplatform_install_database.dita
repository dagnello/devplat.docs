      <title>Availability Zones</title>
      <p>To configure the Database Service in a highly available manner, it is necessary to create
        separate availability zones. As a best practice, HPE recommends creating three availability
        zones. All compute hosts should be placed within one of these availability zones. If a
        compute host is not associated with an availability zone, the Database Service will not be
        able to provision a database instance to it. As a result, the Database Service may run out
        of capacity even though there are compute hosts with free capacity.</p>
      <p>The following steps show how to create three availability zones and assign a compute host
        to the zone.</p>
      <ol>
        <li> Connect to an overcloud controller node and execute the following commands to create
          three availability zones named: "AZ-1", "AZ-2" and
          "AZ-3".<codeblock>nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-1 AZ-1
nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-2 AZ-2
nova aggregate-create aggregate-AZ-3 AZ-3</codeblock></li>
        <li> Validate that the availability zones were correctly created by issuing the following
          command.<codeblock>nova aggregate-list</codeblock></li>
        <li> The following commands will add a compute host to your newly created availability
          zones. Issue this command for every compute host that you wish to associate with an
          availability
          zone.<codeblock>nova aggregate-add-host &lt;id&gt; &lt;hostname&gt;</codeblock></li>
        <li> The following command can be used to list all availability zones and the compute hosts
          associated with them.<codeblock>nova availability-zone-list</codeblock></li>
      </ol>

      <title>Quotas</title>
      <p>The <b>Database Service</b> will be installed into the admin tenant of the HPE Helion
        OpenStack overcloud and the admin tenant must have sufficient quota available and unused

        the <b>admin</b> user and open the <b>Overview</b> panel under the <b>Compute</b> tab.</p>

        quota. The users database service quota will also be affected.</p>
