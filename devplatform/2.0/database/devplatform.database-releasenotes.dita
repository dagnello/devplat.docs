    <section><title>No option to reset password on Vertica Preview instance on Horizon</title>
      <p>Vertica clusters can be accessed via credentials obtained by enabling root, either through Horizon or the Trove CLI. Single node 
        Vertica instances must have root enabled through the Trove CLI, as this action is not available in Horizon. </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <codeblock>trove root-enable &lt;instance&gt;</codeblock>

    <section><title>Searching for log entries returns API KEY ERROR: Missing</title>
      <p>The current Vertica Management Console release has a known issue where attempting to search
        for Vertica log entries may result in an API key being requested. As a workaround, it is
        suggested to access Vertica event data directly through the database's ACTIVE_EVENTS,
        QUERY_EVENTS and QUERY_REQUESTS tables, as described in <xref
          href="devplatform.database-vertica.dita#topic_q1p_nnp_tt">Managing a Vertica Preview Cluster from the Management Console</xref>.</p></section>
