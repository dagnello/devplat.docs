  <title>HPE Helion 2.0 Development Platform: Preparing for Offline or Pre-Downloaded
    Installation</title>
  <body>
    <p>If downloading directly to the Deployer is not an option for security or other reasons, you
      can pre-download the installation packages for use during installation.</p>
    <p>The pre-download also eliminates the possibility of connection interruptions during
      installation. </p>
    <ol id="ol_bmh_vqp_xt">
      <li> Using your preferred Web browser, navigate to the <xref
          href="https://helion.hpwsportal.com/catalog.html#/Home/Show" format="html"
          scope="external">HPE Helion Download Network</xref> (HDN) and log in. If necessary, create
        an account first.</li>
      <li>For each service:
     <ol> <li>Locate the service to download.</li>
      <li>Click the blue download button at the top right of the screen to download the package to
        your local machine.</li>
      <li>If you did not download directly to the HPE Helion OpenStack deployer, copy all the
        downloaded packages to a USB stick or external hard drive. </li>
      <li>Insert the USB stick or external hard drive into physical machine hosting the HPE Helion
        OpenStack Deployer and copy the installation. Make sure there is enough space; the file
        sizes can be significant.</li></ol></li>
      <li>Follow the installation instructions provided for each service.<note>When installing
          pre-downloaded files, make sure you copy the files to the local directory that you are
          running the installer from. If the installer cannot find a file with the name you provided
          in the local directory, it will attempt to download the files again. </note></li>
