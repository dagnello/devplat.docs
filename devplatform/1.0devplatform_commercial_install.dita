<p>The HPE Helion Development Platform currently contains four products: Application Lifecycle Service (ALS), Marketplace Service, Messaging Service and Database Service.</p>
<p>The following topics explain how to install and configure the HPE Helion Development Platform.</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: If you are installing the HPE Helion Development Platform <b>Community</b> edition, follow the <xref href="../devplatform/1.0devplatform_community_install.dita" >HPE Helion Development Community Installation and Configuration</xref> instructions instead.</p>

<p>The HPE Helion Development Platform is installed in the overcloud of HPE Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm></p>
<p>The system running the installer needs to have Python 2.7. Most modern operating systems include this as part of their base toolkit. This document is geared toward a Linux operating system but this does not preclude the installer from running on other operating systems with some minor modifications to the command-line statements herein.</p>
<p>The installer requires the following packages. If they are not found, it will prompt you to install them.</p>
<ul>
<li>python-dev </li>
<li>libffi-dev </li>
<li>libssl-dev </li>
<li>python-virtualenv</li>
<li>python-pip</li>

<section id="service-is-stuck-in-download"> <title>Service is stuck in download</title>
<p>There are several situations in which a download will not complete.  One cause which is documented, is because the <i>tmp</i> directory ran out of space. There is a prerequisite to mount the <i>tmp</i> directory to a larger partition.  If you have completed this and it is still failing to download then we will need to reset the download. In the current release, this requires a manual process.</p>
<p>Log in to the "admin" tenant as the "admin" user. Click on <b>Project</b> and then click <b>Object Store</b>. Open the <b>sherpa-cache</b> folder and delete the <b>wscatalog</b> folder which contains the cached download. The service should now be available to download again.</p>
<p>
<!-- 

###Image download terminated

The image download is terminated for some reason and even after retrying to download the image  the status of service remains unchanged, i.e, the status still remains *staged*.

**Resolution**

Perform the following steps:
  
1. Delete the images for that Development Platform service. (do we need to login to Horizon and delete the image or are there any command line used to delete the image for that development platform? If any please specify how should a user delete it?)
2. Login to Horizon as "admin" user and click Object Store Delete the heat-templates for the service from Object store -> Containers.( Is this all performed in Horizon and as a user or admin)
c) Delete the wscatalog for the service under container -> Sherpa-cache in Object store.
Even after that , you do not see status changed to Available for the service in configure services page. Then it means Sherpa is looking at file cache .
     a) Connect to controller mgmt node  delete the directory  /var/cache/sherpa/ws.xxxx, in order to reset the state
    b) service apache2 restart for this change to take effect .

The service should now be available to download again.

If  the status still remains unchanged in the Configure Service page then Sherpa is referring to the file cache. To delete the file cache, perform the following:
        
* Connect to the controller management node  and delete the directory  `/var/cache/sherpa/ws.xxxx`, to reset the state. ( What is the exact file name for ws.xxxx)
     
* Delete the contents of the `/var/lib/Sherpa/data` folder. 

* Restart the service apache2 for this change to take effect .
