          Agreement.</li>

        <ul id="ul_fcj_gv3_dt">
          <li>You may not use Software to provide products or services to third parties.</li>
          <li>You may not make copies and distribute, resell, sublicense or provide access to the
            Software to third parties.</li>
          <li>You may not download and use patches, enhancements, bug fixes, or similar updates
            unless you have a license to the underlying Software. However, such license doesn't
            automatically give you a right to receive such updates and HPE reserves the right to make
            such updates only available to customers with support contracts.</li>
          <li>You may not copy Software or make it available on a public or external distributed
            network.</li>
          <li>You may not allow access on an intranet unless it is restricted to authorized
            users.</li>

            step in authorized use.</li>
          <li>You may not modify, reverse engineer, disassemble, decrypt, decompile, or make
            derivative works of Software except as permitted by law. </li>
        </ul></li><li>
          <b>Remote Monitoring. </b>Some software may require keys or other technical protection
          measures and HPE may monitor your compliance with the Agreement, remotely or otherwise. If
          HPE makes a license management program for recording and reporting license usage
          information, you will use such program no later than 180 days from the date it's made
          available.</li>
        <li><b>Ownership. </b>No transfer of ownership of any intellectual property will occur under
          this Agreement.</li>
        <li><b>Copyright Notices. </b>You must reproduce copyright notices on software and
          documentation for authorized copies.</li>
        <li><b>90-day Limited Warranty for HPE Software. </b>HP-branded software is free of malware
          at the time of delivery; if you notify HPE within 90 days of delivery of non-conformance to
          this warranty, HPE will replace your copy. This Agreement states all remedies for warranty
          claims. HPE does not warrant that the operation of software will be uninterrupted or error
          free, or that software will operate in hardware and software combinations other than as
          authorized by HPE in Supporting Material. To the extent permitted by law, HPE disclaims all
          other warranties.</li>
        <li><b>Intellectual Property Rights Infringement. </b>Subject to Section 14(e) of this Part
          1,HPE will defend and/or settle any claims against you that allege that HP-branded software
          as supplied under this Agreement infringes the intellectual property rights of a third
          party. HPE will rely on your prompt notification of the claim and cooperation with our
          defense. HPE may modify the software so as to be non-infringing and materially equivalent,
          or we may procure a license. If these options are not available, we will refund to you the
          amount paid for the affected product in the first year or the depreciated value
          thereafter. HPE is not responsible for claims resulting from any unauthorized use of the
          software.</li>
        <li><b>Limitation of Liability. </b>HP's liability to you under this Agreement is limited to
          the amount actually paid by you to HPE for the relevant software, except for amounts in
          Section 11 ("Intellectual Property Rights Infringement"). Neither you nor HPE will be
          liable for lost revenues or profits, downtime costs, loss or damage to data or indirect,
          special or consequential costs or damages. This provision does not limit either party's
          liability for: unauthorized use of intellectual property, death or bodily injury caused by
          their negligence; acts of fraud; willful repudiation of the Agreement; or any liability
          that may not be excluded or limited by applicable law.</li>
        <li><b>Termination. </b>This Agreement is effective until terminated or in the case of a
          limited-term license, upon expiration; however, your rights under this Agreement terminate
          if you fail to comply with it. Immediately upon termination or expiration, you will
          destroy the software and documentation and any copies, or return them to HP. You may keep
          one copy of software and documentation for archival purposes. We may ask you to certify in
          writing you have complied with this section. Warranty disclaimers, the limitation of
          liability, this section on termination, and Section 14 ("General") will survive
          termination.</li>
        <li><b>General.</b><ol>
            <li><b>Assignment</b>. You may not assign this Agreement without prior written consent
              of HPE payment of transfer fees and compliance with HP's software license transfer
              policies. Authorized assignments will terminate your license to the software and you
              must deliver software and documentation and copies thereof to the assignee. The
              assignee will agree in writing to this Agreement. You may only transfer firmware if
              you transfer associated hardware.</li>

              regulations of the U.S. and other national governments. If you export, import or

              obtaining any required export or import authorizations. You confirm that you are not
              located in a country that is subject to trade control sanctions (currently Cuba, Iran,

              products to any such country. HPE may suspend its performance under this Agreement to
              the extent required by laws applicable to either party.</li>
            <li><b>Audit.</b> HPE may audit you for compliance with the software license terms. Upon
              reasonable notice, HPE may conduct an audit during normal business hours (with the
              auditor's costs being at HP's expense). If an audit reveals underpayments then you
              will pay to HPE such underpayments. If underpayments discovered exceed five (5)
              percent, you will reimburse HPE for the auditor costs.</li>
            <li><b>Third Party and Open Source Components.</b> To the extent any component of the
              software is subject to any third party license terms, including open source license
              terms, then those third party license terms or open source license terms shall govern
              with respect to the subject component; otherwise, the terms of this Agreement shall
              govern.</li>
            <li><b>Notices.</b> Written notices under this Agreement may be provided to HPE via the
              method provided in the Supporting Material or if none, via "contact HP" site on

              that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
              will not apply.</li>
            <li><b>Force Majeure</b>. Neither party will be liable for performance delays nor for
              non-performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, except for payment
              obligations.</li>
            <li><b>Entire Agreement</b>. This Agreement represents our entire understanding with
              respect to its subject matter and supersedes any previous communication or agreements
              that may exist. Modifications to the Agreement will be made only through a written
              amendment signed by both parties. If HPE doesn't exercise its rights under this
              Agreement, such delay is not a waiver of its rights.</li>
            <li><b>Australian Consumers</b>. If you acquired the software as a consumer within the
              meaning of the 'Australian Consumer Law' under the Australian <i>Competition and
