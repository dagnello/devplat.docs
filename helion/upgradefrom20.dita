  <title>Upgrading to HPE Helion OpenStack&#174; 2.0 to 2.0.1</title>
  <body>
    <section>
      <title>Performing the Upgrade from HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0  to 2.0.1</title>HPE Helion
      OpenStack 2.0 shipped with example configuration files, and you were able to modify them to
      suit your needs. </section>
    <section><note type="caution">The configuration you specified will remain unchanged through the upgrade
        process; <b>however</b>, if you made any configuration changes by passing parameters to any
        Ansible playbooks using the -e option, you should find the affected files and make the
        required changes directly in the files in <b>helion/my_cloud</b> and commit them to the git
        repository so that those changes are tracked and applied during the upgrade process.
        Otherwise they will not be applied.</note></section>
    <section>You may also install HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0.1 as a full install. Those instructions
      are found in the installation guide.</section>
    <section>To begin the upgrade process, log in to the lifecyce manager node as the user you
      created during the HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0 deployment, and mount the install media at
        <b>/media/cdrom</b>; for example:
      <codeblock>sudo mount hLinux-cattleprod-amd64-blaster-netinst-20151009-hlm.2015-11-13T07:32:19_caf1ffc.iso /media/cdrom  </codeblock>
      Unpack the following
      tarball:<codeblock>tar faxv /media/cdrom/hos-2.0.1/hos-2.0.1.manifest-20151113T062512Z.tar</codeblock>
      Run the included initialization script to update the deployer:
      <codeblock>~/hos-2.0.1/hos-init.bash</codeblock> Run the configuration processor:
      <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock>
      Run the ready deployment playbook:
      <codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock> Run the
      upgrade playbook:
      <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
