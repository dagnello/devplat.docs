  <title>HPE Helion <tm tmtype="reg">OpenStack</tm> 2.0: Swift Requirements for Device Group
    Drives</title>
  <body>
    <p>To install and deploy, Swift requires that the disk drives listed in the devices list of the
      device-groups item in a disk model meet the following criteria (if not, the deployment will
      fail):</p>
    <ul id="ul_fsy_255_dt">
      <li>The disk device must exist on the server. For example, if you add
          <codeph>/dev/sdx</codeph> to a server with only three devices, then the deploy process
        will fail.</li>
      <li>The disk device must be unpartitioned or have a single partition that uses the whole
        drive.</li>
      <li>The partition must not be labelled. For instructions, see <xref
          href="label_on_partition.dita#verify-partition-label"/>.</li>
      <li>The XFS file system must not contain a file system label. For instructions, see <xref
          href="filesystem_label.dita#verify-the-filesystem-label"/>.</li>
      <li>If the disk drive is already labeled as described above, the
          <codeph>swiftlm-drive-provision</codeph> process will assume that the drive has valuable
        data and will not use or modify the drive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may have several device groups if you have several different uses for different sets of
      drives.</p>
    <p>The following example shows a configuration where one drive is used for account and container
      rings and the other drives are used by the object-0 ring:</p>
    <codeblock>device-groups:

- name: swiftpac
  devices:
  - name: /dev/sdb
  consumer:
      name: swift
      attrs:
      - name: account
      - name: container
- name: swiftobj
  devices:
  - name: /dev/sdc
  - name: /dev/sde
  - name: /dev/sdf
  consumer:
      name: swift
      attrs:
          rings:
          - name: object-0</codeblock>
  </body>
