    <p>HPE Helion Managed Cloud with Helion OpenStack provides a dedicated, single tenant, HPE
      Helion OpenStack 2.0-based managed private cloud, hosted in HPE data centers. This enterprise
      grade, rapidly-provisioned private cloud service is available to customers in an OpEx model.
      HPE Helion OpenStack provides an open source and highly-configurable infrastructure as a
      service (IaaS). The optional HPE Helion Development Platform gives developers a powerful set
      of tools to migrate traditional applications, build cloud native applications, and deploy both
      to an open and integrated platform as a service (PaaS) layer.</p>
