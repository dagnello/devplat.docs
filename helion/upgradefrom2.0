      <title>Performing the Upgrade from HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0</title>
      <note><b>The names of the download files and other details are likely to change before the
          update bits are released.</b></note> The starting point for upgrading is a working
      deployment of the HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0 released version. You must have an operational
      version of a 2.0 cloud. HPE Helion OpenStack 2.0 shipped with example configuration files, and
      you were able to modify them to suit your needs. The configuration you specified will remain
      unchanged through the upgrade process.</section>
    <section>To begin, log in to the deployer node as the user you created during the HPE Helion
      OpenStack 2.0 deployment, and mount the install media at <b>/media/cdrom</b>; for example:
      <codeblock>sudo mount hLinux-cattleprod-amd64-blaster-netinst-20151005-hlm.&lt;<i>build-date_sha1</i>>.iso /media/cdrom</codeblock>
      Unpack the following tarball: <b>Note needs file name
      </b><codeblock>tar faxv /media/cdrom/hos/hos-2.0.0-rc1-20151012T062322Z.tar</codeblock> Run
      the included initialization script to update the deployer:
      <codeblock>~/hos-2.0.0-b.rc1/hos-init.bash</codeblock> Prepare the new Ansible tree for the
      upgrade run,, assuming you have made the necessary YAML config file changes above. Resolve any
      merge conflicts that may have arisen: <codeblock>cd ~/helion
git status</codeblock> Run the
      configuration processor:
      <codeblock>cd ~/helion/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost config-processor-run.yml</codeblock>
      Run the ready deployment playbook:
      <codeblock>ansible-playbook -i hosts/localhost ready-deployment.yml</codeblock> Run the
      upgrade playbook:
      <codeblock>cd ~/scratch/ansible/next/hos/ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts/verb_hosts hlm-upgrade.yml</codeblock>
