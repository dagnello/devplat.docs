    <section><title>What is Ceph?</title>OpenStack Ceph is a software-defined storage (SDS) system
      comprised of a block storage, object storage, and a file system. It is designed to deliver
      different types of storage interfaces to the end user in a single storage platform. Therefore
      Ceph is termed a unified storage platform.</section>
    <section><title>HPE Helion OpenStack : Ceph Overview</title><p>Based on OpenStack Ceph, HPE Helion
        OpenStack 2.0 Ceph Storage Solution provides a unified, scalable, and stable storage
        solution for the management of the HPE Helion OpenStack Volume Storage (Cinder persistent
        Volumes)
        service.<!--<b>did not understand this line-please
