        <p>Each of these groups is run in 1:1 HA mode by the controllers. This means that while some
      service groups can be active on controller-0, and in standby on controller-1, others are
      active on controller-1, and in standby on controller-0.</p>
        <p>The high-availability framework constantly monitors and reports on the health of the
      individual services within each of the service groups on both controllers. When a service
      fails, a decision is made on whether to restart it on the same controller, or to switch the
      corresponding service group to the other controller. This decision depends on the criticality
      and the dependencies of the affected service.</p>
        <p>For maintenance purposes, when one of the controller nodes needs to be powered down for
      service, it is necessary to force all currently active service groups in one controller to
      switch to the other. This can be done from the <uicontrol>Hosts</uicontrol> tab on the
        <wintitle>Inventory</wintitle> page, by selecting the option <option>swact</option> (switch
      active) in the <uicontrol>More</uicontrol> menu of the controller you want to take out of
      service.</p>

            <title>The Active Controller</title>
            <p>Services in the <codeph>Controller
                    Services</codeph> group drive core functionality in HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. The
                controller where they are running is referred to as the <term>active</term> controller. The <uicontrol>Hosts</uicontrol> tab
                in the <wintitle>System Inventory</wintitle> page of the <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> panel lists the status of all hosts in the
                cluster; it reports the active controller as having the <term>Controller-Active</term> personality.</p>
            <p>When working from the CLI on a controller node it is often important
                to ensure that you are working on the active controller, for example, to execute
                OpenStack <codeph>admin</codeph> operations, or to change
                the password of the <codeph>wrsroot</codeph> user account.
                See <xref href="jow1404333563834.xml"/> for further details on the
                    <codeph>wrsroot</codeph> account.</p>
            <p>You can ensure you are working on the active controller by using the
                OAM floating IP address as the destination address in the SSH command.</p>
