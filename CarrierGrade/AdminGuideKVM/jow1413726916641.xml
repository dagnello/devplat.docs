            <p>During software installation, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is configured with an
                OAM network subnet and related IP addresses. You can change these addresses using
                the web administration interface or the CLI.</p>
            <note id="note_N1002F_N1002B_N1001D_N10001" type="caution">
                <p>Access to the OAM network is interrupted during this procedure. When a swact is
                    performed on the controllers, the newly active controller uses the changed OAM
                    IP addresses. The existing OAM IP addresses are no longer valid, and you must
                    use the new OAM IP addresses to reconnect to the controller. Changes to external
                    OAM access routing settings may also be required. In addition, VNC console
                    access to compute-node hosts is interrupted until the hosts are locked and
                    unlocked.</p>
