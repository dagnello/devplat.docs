            <p>This section presents a example patching workflow using the single patch
                TITANIUM_14.10_PATCH_0001. </p>
        
        <ol>
             
                <li>Log in to the web administration interface as the
                        <codeph>admin</codeph> user.</li>
            
             
                <li>Visit the <b>Patches</b> page to see the current patch
                    status.
                
                    <p>Click the <b>Admin</b> tab on the System Panel, select
                            <b>Inventory</b> to display the <b>System
                            Inventory</b> page, and then click the
                            <b>Patches</b> tab.</p>
                
                
                    <p>The <b>Patches</b> page is
                        displayed presenting the current status of all patches uploaded to the
                        system. If there are no patches, an empty page is displayed as illustrated
                        below.</p>

                </li>
             
                <li>Upload the patch file to the patch storage area.
                
                    <p>Click the <b>Upload
                            Patch</b> button to display an upload window from which you can
                        browse your workstation's file system to select the patch file. Press the
                            <b>Upload Patch</b> button once the
                        selection is done.</p>
                
                
                    <p>The patch file is available now in the patch storage area, but it has yet to
                        be applied to the cluster. This is reflected in the
                            <b>Patches</b> page as illustrated below.</p>

            <li>Apply the patch.
                
                    <p>Click the <b>Apply
                            Patch</b> button associated with the patch. Alternatively,
                        select the patch first using the selection boxes on the left, and then click
                        the <b>Apply Patches</b> button at the top.
                        You can use this selection process to apply all patches, or a selected
                        subset, in a single operation.</p>
                
                
                    <p>The <b>Patches</b> page is updated to report the patch to be in
                        the <i>Partial-Apply</i> state.</p>

                            Inventory</b> page is also updated to reflect the new status of
                        the hosts with respect to the new patch state. As illustrated in the
                        following image, both controllers are now reported as not patch current and
                        requiring reboot.</p>

                being applied.</p>
