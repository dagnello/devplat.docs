    <title>PCI Passthrough Ethernet Interfaces</title>
    <shortdesc>A <term>passthrough</term> Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet NIC on a
        compute node to which a virtual machine is granted direct access. This minimizes packet
        processing delays but at the same time demands special operational
        considerations.</shortdesc>

            <p>For all purposes, a PCI passthrough interface behaves as if it were
                physically attached to the virtual machine. Therefore any potential throughput
                limitations coming from the virtualized environment, such as the ones introduced by
                internal copying of data buffers, are eliminated. However, by bypassing the
                virtualized environment, the use of PCI passthrough Ethernet devices introduces
                several restrictions that must be taken into consideration. They include:</p>
            <ul id="ul_mjs_m52_tp">
                <li>
                    <p>no support for LAG, QoS, ACL, or host interface monitoring</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>no support for live migration</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>no access to the compute node's AVS switch</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>A passthrough interface bypasses the compute node's AVS switch
                completely, and is attached instead directly to the provider network's access
                switch. Therefore, proper routing of traffic to connect the passthrough interface to
                a particular tenant network depends entirely on the VLAN tagging options configured
                on both the passthrough interface and the access port on the switch.</p>
            <p>The access switch routes incoming traffic based on a VLAN ID, which ultimately
                determines the tenant network to which the traffic belongs. The VLAN ID is either
                explicit, as found in incoming tagged packets, or implicit, as defined by the access
                port's default VLAN ID when the incoming packets are untagged. In both cases the
                access switch must be configured to process the proper VLAN ID, which therefore has
                to be known in advance.</p>
            <p>To review the current PCI passthrough and SR-IOV device assignments
                for a given provider network, see <xref href="jow1439301559036.xml"/>.</p>
            <p>In the following example a new virtual machine is launched by user
                    <codeph>user1</codeph> on tenant <codeph>tenant1</codeph>, with a passthrough interface connected to
                the tenant network <codeph>net0</codeph> identified with
                VLAN ID 10.</p>
        
        
            <note id="note_N10096_N10082_N10029_N10001">
                <p>To use PCI passthrough or SR-IOV interfaces, you must have Intel
                    VT-d features enabled in the BIOS.</p>
            </note>
            <p>The exercise assumes that the underlying provider network
                    <codeph>group0-data0</codeph> exists already, and that VLAN ID 10 is a
                valid segmentation ID assigned to <codeph>tenant1</codeph>.</p>

                        interface is available, click the <b>Interfaces</b> tab, and finally click the <b>Edit Interface</b> button associated with the
                        interface you want to configure. Fill in the window as illustrated
                        below:</p>

                    <p>In this example, Ethernet interface <codeph>eth8</codeph> is assigned the network type <term>pci-passthrough</term>, and configured as connected to provider network

                    <p>The interface can also be configured from the CLI as

                            <b>Create Network</b> button. Fill in
                        the <b>Create Network</b> window as
                        illustrated below. You must ensure that:</p>

                        <li>

                        connect to Ethernet interface <codeph>eth8</codeph> as an access port with default VLAN ID of 10.
                        Traffic across the connection is therefore untagged, and effectively
                        integrated into the targeted tenant network.</p>
                    <p>You can also use a trunk port on the access switch so that it
                        handles tagged packets as well. However, this opens the possibility for
                        guest applications to join other tenant networks using tagged packets with
                        different VLAN IDs, which might compromise the security of the system. See
                            <xref href="jow1404333739778.xml"/> for other details regarding the
                        configuration of the access switch.</p>
