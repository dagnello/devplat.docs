    <title>Security Groups</title>
    <shortdesc>Security groups are tenant-specific sets of IP filter rules that are
        applied to the networking stack of a virtual machine.</shortdesc>

        <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade does not enforce a default security group when launching
            a new virtual machine. Instead, the security groups are optional, and only enforced when
            explicitly assigned to a virtual machine, either at launch time, or while it is
            executing.</p>
        <p>At launch time, select the desired security groups from the tab <b>Access &amp;
    Security</b> on the <b>Launch Instance</b> window, as illustrated
   below.</p>

        <p>To assign security groups to a running instance, display the <b>Instances</b>
   page, click the <b>More</b> button associated with the instance, and select the
   option <option>Edit Security Groups</option>. The <b>Edit Instance</b> window
   displays with the tab <b>Security Groups</b> showing the available security
   instance groups, as illustrated below.</p>

        <p>You can then drag and drop security groups from the section <codeph>All Security
    Groups</codeph> to the section <codeph>Instance Security Groups</codeph>. The
   selected security groups are applied immediately once the configuration is saved.</p>
        <p>In the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade implementation, the following limitations apply:</p>
        <ul id="ul_uyw_pzl_44">
            <li>
                <p>the maximum number of security groups that can be applied to a single tenant network is
     10</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>the maximum number of rules that can be configured on a single tenant network is 100</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These two limitations work always together, whichever is first
            reached.</p>
