 <title>System Configuration Management</title>
 <shortdesc>You can make changes to the initial HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade configuration at any
  time after installation.</shortdesc>
 <prolog><author/>
  
 </prolog>
 <body>
  <p>The initial configuration is defined during software installation, using the
    <codeph>config_controller</codeph> script (see the <cite>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Software Installation Guide: Configuring Controller-0). </cite> After
   installation, you can make changes using the web administration interface or the CLI. For most
   types of changes, you can do this without interrupting system operations.</p>
  <p>You can change the initial configuration as follows:</p>
  <ul id="ul_ghh_hfp_5p">
   <li>
    <p>Reconfigure aspects of the External OAM network, including the subnet,
     controller IP addresses, gateway IP address, and floating IP address.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Change the DNS server IP addresses.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Change the NTP server IP addresses.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Change the disk allocations for database storage, image storage, backup
     storage, and Cinder volume storage.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Add an infrastructure network if one is not already configured.</p>
    <note id="note_N10069_N10062_N10036_N1001F_N10001">
     <p>A service interruption is required to add an infrastructure network; all
      nodes except the active controller must be locked. In addition, you must use the CLI to make
      this change.</p>
    </note>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Immediately before making a change, ensure the following:</p>
  <ul id="ul_o1p_hb2_vp">
   <li>
    <p>All hosts are unlocked.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>No <codeph>Major</codeph> or <codeph>Critical</codeph>
     alarms are shown for the system on the Fault Management page.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>No <codeph>250.001 Configuration out-of-date</codeph> alarms are
     shown for the system on the Fault Management page.</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>During these changes, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade can remain online and operational. For
   some types of changes, alarms are raised while the settings are in transition. To make the
   changes take effect and to clear the alarms, individual hosts must be locked and then unlocked
   one at a time. For more information, see <xref href="jow1413726817770.xml"/>.</p>
  <p>Only hosts with <codeph>250.001 Configuration out-of-date</codeph>
   alarms need to be locked and then unlocked. When locking and unlocking the hosts to clear the
   alarms, use the following order:</p>
  <ol id="ol_wnd_nzd_vp">
   <li>
    <p>controller nodes</p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>compute nodes</p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <note id="note_N1006C_N1001F_N10001">
   <p>To keep the system operational during an OAM network change, sufficient
    resources must be available to migrate the virtual machines on a compute node while it is locked
    for changes.</p>
  </note>
  <p>To make changes using the web administration interface, you must be logged in
   as the <codeph>admin</codeph> user.  Use the <wintitle>System Configuration</wintitle> pane, is available from the <uicontrol>System
    Panel</uicontrol> section of the <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> menu. </p>
  <p>To make changes using the CLI, you must be logged in as the
    <codeph>wrsroot</codeph> user on the active controller, and sourced as the Keystone
    <codeph>admin</codeph> user. For more information, see <xref href="jow1413729179585.xml"/>.</p>
