    <title>Live Migration of Virtual Machines</title>
    <shortdesc>Live migration occurs when a virtual machine is transferred to execute
        on a different compute node with minimal disruption of the guest applications. This can
        happen automatically, or upon request by the system administrator.</shortdesc>

        <note id="note_N10026_N10023_N10001">
            <p>Live migration is not currently supported for instances using the following:</p>
            <ul id="ul_ccz_fjc_gs">
                <li>
                    <p>PCI passthrough</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>SR-IOV</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Local storage</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </note>
        <p>While executing a live migration operation, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade manages the
            virtual machine's state in such a way that it appears unmodified on the migrated
            instance. This includes:</p>
        <ul id="ul_e3n_drn_j4">
            <li>
                <p>system memory, both kernel and user space</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>access to all non-local storage resources, including LVM/iSCSI and
                    Cinder</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>all the virtual machine networking options (unmodified/virtio, AVP kernel driver, AVP
          DPDK Poll Mode Driver), and AVS</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Automatic migration of virtual machines occurs whenever the administrator
            initiates a locking operation on a compute node. In this case, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade first
            live-migrates all virtual machine instances off of the compute node before
            administratively locking it.</p>
        <p>The <codeph>admin</codeph> user can also
            initiate live migrations manually from the <wintitle>Instances</wintitle> page available by clicking the option <option>Instances</option> on the <uicontrol>Admin</uicontrol> side pane of
            the web management interface. The <option>More</option> button of the
            selected instance provides the option <option>Live Migrate
                Instance</option>. When selected, the <wintitle>Live
                Migrate</wintitle> window is displayed as illustrated below:</p>

        <p>The following fields are available:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Current Host</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>A read-only field displaying the compute node the selected instance is currently
            running on.</p>
                </dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>New Host</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>The target compute node for the migration. The default value
                        is to let HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade auto-schedule the virtual machine following the
                        current scheduling guidelines and constraints. Optionally, you can manually
                        select the target compute node.</p>
                    <p>Note that the set of available target compute nodes for the
                        migration is still subject to the scheduler constraints from the virtual
                        machine flavor and other systems options that might be in place.</p>

            <title>Live Migration and Server Group Policies</title>
            <p>Virtual machines launched as part of a Server Group are subject to additional live
                migration restrictions determined by the selection of scheduling policy. See <xref href="jow1404333660893.xml"/> for details.</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>The goal of this policy is to schedule all virtual machines in the Server
                            Group to execute on the same host.</p>
                        <p>If the <codeph>Best
                                Effort</codeph> flag of the Server Group is clear, then the
                            individual instances cannot be migrated since this would break the
                            affinity policy.</p>
                        <p>Note that this means that a compute node running
                            instances in a Server Group with affinity policy in strict mode cannot
                            be locked. An alternative mode of operation is to always set the
                                <codeph>Best Effort</codeph> flag and then
                            manually migrate the instances to a common host.</p>
                        <p>If the <codeph>Best Effort</codeph> flag of the Server Group is
                            set, then any individual instances can migrate to any other available
