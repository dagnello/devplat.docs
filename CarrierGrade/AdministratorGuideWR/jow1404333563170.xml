    <shortdesc >The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade architecture supports various types of host,


        networks, and networking hardware in different configurations. In this documentation, a


        reference configuration is used for discussion.</shortdesc>

            <p >The reference configuration assumes that the controller and compute


                functions are implemented on different hosts. HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade also supports a


                minimal two-server configuration in which these functions are implemented on the


                same host. For more information, see the <cite >HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade


                    Software Installation Guide: Minimal Two-server Configuration</cite>. </p>

            <title>About Tenants (Projects) and Users</title>


            <p >Tenants and users are system resources managed by the OpenStack


                Keystone service.</p>


            <p >Tenants are the core resource structure on which all end user services are managed. They


        are isolated resource containers consisting of networks, storage volumes, images, virtual


        machines, authentication keys, and users.</p>


            <p >When the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is deployed, two default tenants are


                created: <b >admin</b> and <b >services</b>. They are used to group resources to be


                associated with the user <b >admin</b> and the


                cloud services, respectively.</p>


            <note id="note_N10211_N101ED_N1001C_N10001" >


                <p >Earlier versions of OpenStack used the term <term >project</term>


                    instead of <term >tenant</term>. Because of this legacy terminology, the web


                    administration interface uses both terms, and some command-line tools use


                        <b >--project_id</b> when a tenant ID is


                    expected.</p>


            </note>


            <p >Users are system resources that can operate on one or more tenants, within the constraints


        of a particular role. For each user, the Keystone service maintains a list of (tenant, role)


        tuples, which are used to determine the tenants the user can operate on, and the role the


        user should play on each of them.</p>


            <p >In the default installation of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade, several users are already defined. Each


        of the OpenStack services, such as Nova and Neutron, exist as system users. They all operate


        on the default tenant <b >services</b>.</p>


            <p >The Keystone <b >admin</b> user


                is associated with the <b >admin</b> tenant.


                This user has administrator privileges for creating, modifying, and deleting


                OpenStack resources, including creating other tenants and users.</p>


            <p ><b>Note:</b> In this document, after this point, all references to


                contoller-0 and controller-1 are specific to the KVM region only. </p>
