    <title>Security Groups</title>


    <shortdesc >Security groups are tenant-specific sets of IP filter rules that are


        applied to the networking stack of a virtual machine.</shortdesc>

        <p >The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade does not enforce a default security group when launching a new


            virtual machine. Instead, the security groups are optional, and only enforced when


            explicitly assigned to a virtual machine, either at launch time, or while it is


            executing.</p>


        <p >At launch time, select the desired security groups from the tab <uicontrol >Access &amp;


    Security</uicontrol> on the <wintitle >Launch Instance</wintitle> window, as illustrated


   below.</p>

        </fig>


        <p >To assign security groups to a running instance, display the <wintitle >Instances</wintitle>


   page, click the <uicontrol >More</uicontrol> button associated with the instance, and select the


   option <option >Edit Security Groups</option>. The <wintitle >Edit Instance</wintitle> window


   displays with the tab <uicontrol >Security Groups</uicontrol> showing the available security


   instance groups, as illustrated below.</p>

        </fig>


        <p >You can then drag and drop security groups from the section <b >All Security


    Groups</b> to the section <b >Instance Security Groups</b>. The


   selected security groups are applied immediately once the configuration is saved.</p>


        <p >In the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade implementation, the following limitations apply:</p>


        <ul id="ul_uyw_pzl_44">


            <li >


                <p >the maximum number of security groups that can be applied to a single tenant network is


     10</p>


            </li>


            <li >


                <p >the maximum number of rules that can be configured on a single tenant network is 100</p>


            </li>


        </ul>


        <p >These two limitations work always together, whichever is first


            reached.</p>
