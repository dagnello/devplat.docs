    <title>Removing Patches</title>


    <shortdesc >Patches in the <i >Applied</i> or <i 


            >Partial-Apply</i> states can be removed if necessary, for example, when they trigger


        undesired or unplanned effects on the cluster.</shortdesc>

            <p >Rolling back patches is conceptually identical to installing patches.


                A roll-back operation can be commanded for a patch in either the <i >Applied</i> or the <i >Partial-Apply</i> states. As the patch is


                removed, it goes through the following state transitions:</p>


            <dl>


                <dlentry >


                    <dt ><i >Applied</i> or <i >Partial-Apply</i> to <i >Partial-Remove</i></dt>


                    <dd >


                        <p >A patch in the <i >Partial-Remove</i>


                            state indicates that it has been removed from zero or more, but not from


                            all, the applicable hosts.</p>


                        <p >Use the command <i>wrs-patch


                                remove</i> to trigger this transition.</p>


                    </dd>


                </dlentry>


                <dlentry >


                    <dt ><i >Partial-Remove</i> to <i >Available</i></dt>


                    <dd >


                        <p >Use the command <i>wrs-patch


                                host-install</i> repeatedly targeting each time one of the


                            applicable hosts in the cluster. The transition to the <i >Available</i> state is complete when the patch is


                            removed from all target hosts. The patch remains in the patch storage


                            area as if it had just been uploaded.</p>


                    </dd>


                </dlentry>


            </dl>


            <p >The following example is basically a copy of the workflow used in


                    <xref href="psa1410446976545.xml" />, but this time removing


                instead of installing the patch. The ol are therefore presented in simplified


                form.</p>

            <p >It is important to note the role of the command <i>wrs-path

                necessary.</p>
