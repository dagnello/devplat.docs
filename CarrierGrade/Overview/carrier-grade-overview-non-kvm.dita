    <p>For installation and maintenance, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade consists of three logical
      or conceptual <i>regions</i>: Non-KVM, KVM, and baremetal. </p>
    <p>The Non-KVM region contains the lifecycle manager, to deploy and maintain HP Helion OpenStack
      Carrier Grade; and HP Helion OpenStack, a commercial-grade distribution of OpenStack.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> These regions do not function as OpenStack regions. </p>
    <section><title>Lifecycle Manager</title>All four deployment models install the lifecycle
      manager into the non-KVM region.<p>The Non-KVM environment includes a full installation of a
        lifecycle manager, an application that is used to deploy HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
        and can be used for ongoing operations and maintenance of the system.</p><ul
        id="ul_bhj_clv_ls">
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Physical Node Preparation.</b> The lifecycle manager can configure nodes prior to
            installation of a base operating system, including node discovery/inventory, BIOS
            configuration, (specifically setting PXE boot on primary interface), GRUB settings, RAID
            setup for local disks, iLO/IPMI set up and firmware upgrades.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>OS Install.</b> The lifecycle manager can take a PXE bootable node and installs a
            base operating system.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Cloud Configuration.</b> The lifecycle manager can provide detailed information about
            the cloud topology, such as the structure of control plane, assignment of services to
            nodes, and service configuration. You can also specify environment-specific
            configurations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>OS Configuration.</b> The lifecycle manager can automatically execute operating
            system configuration values, such as NIC assignments, NTP settings, DNS settings, NIC
            bonding, sysctl settings, VLAN creation and so forth. The lifecycle manager uses the
            Ansible data model output and server playbooks to automatically apply the per-node
            configurations.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Helion Operation &amp; Maintenance.</b> The lifecycle manager is responsible for the
            deploy, upgrade and maintenance lifecycle of the HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade
            system.</p>

      <title>HP Helion OpenStack</title>
      <p>All four deployment models install HP Helion OpenStack into the non-KVM region.</p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is a carrier-grade distribution of OpenStack the leading
        open source cloud computing platform. This distribution, backed by HPE enables customers to
        more easily build, manage, and use open-source based hybrid cloud in a resilient,
        maintainable platform. HP Helion OpenStack enables cost-effective scalability of IT services
        and business agility and, as part of the HP Helion portfolio, it is backed by a wide range
        of related cloud products, services, and professional support.</p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack offers many services based on the different OpenStack projects to
        provide the functionality you need. Visit the <xref

      <title>HP Distributed Cloud Networking (DCN)</title>
      <p>The Tahoe, Memphis, and Sacramento deployment models include HP DCN.</p>
      <p>The optional HPE DCN is a software-Defined Networking (SDN) solution that enhances data
        center (DC) network virtualization by automatically establishing connectivity between
        compute resources upon their creation. </p>
    </section>
    <section><title>ESX Integration</title>The Memphis, and Sacramento deployment models include
      VMWare ESX<tm tmtype="reg"/>.<p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade optionally supports VMWare
          ESX<tm tmtype="reg"/> hypervisor using HPE Distributed Cloud Networking (aka DCN). With
        our ESX integration, the cloud can provision and manage an ESX cluster. VMWare Compute Proxy
        is used as a part of ESX integration. The VMware vCenter driver connects to ESX clusters
        through Nova Compute proxy nodes. A Compute node scheduler sees each cluster as compute and
        uses the same for scheduling new instances.</p><p><b>DCN/ESX Integration</b></p><p>This
        DCN/ESX integration uses the VRSvAPP application to connect the VMware vCenterâ„¢ networking
        to the Network Operations controller to manage workload networks.</p><p>Virtual networking
        between HP Helion Carrier Grade and the ESX servers is handled by HPE Distributed Cloud
        Networking (DCN) is a software-defined networking (SDN) solution that enhances data center
        (DC) network virtualization by automatically establishing connectivity between compute
        resources upon their creation. </p><p>The ESX integration uses the OVSvApp application to
        connect the vCenter networking to the Network Operations controller to manage workload
        networks.</p><p>ESX region uses mixture of best features from OpenStack, ESX and DCN:</p><ul
        id="ul_p44_snk_ws">
        <li>OpenStack features with rich services such as Keystone, Glance, Nova, Neutron, Cinder,
          Horizon</li>
        <li>ESX provides foundation for building and managing a virtualized IT infrastructure</li>
        <li>ESX provides reliability and performance</li>
        <li>ESX hypervisor abstracts processor, memory and storage</li>
        <li>DCN provides programmable business logic and a powerful policy engine</li>
        <li>DCN provides open and highly responsive solution that scales and span across
          multi-tenant DCs</li>
        <li>Inter-region and Inter-cloud communication between different data centers</li>
        <li>ESX region uses VMDK driver using multi-backend storage support from Cinder </li>
