        Switching</title><!--<p>Taken from http://blogs.windriver.com/wind_river_blog/2014/10/wanted-virtual-switching-without-compromise.html. Must rewrite</p>--><p>Virtual
        switching is a key function within data centers based on Software Defined Networking (SDN)
        as well as in telecom infrastructure that leverages Network Functions Virtualization (NFV).
        </p><p>In the NFV scenario, for example, the virtual switch (vSwitch) is responsible for
        switching network traffic between the core network and the virtualized applications or
        Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that are running in Virtual Machines (VMs). </p><b>HPE DCN
        Virtual Routing Switch (VRS)</b>. HPE DCN VRS is..<p><b> Accelerated vSwitch (AVS)</b>. AVS
        is integrated into the servers in the KVM region. AVS is an optimization of Open vSwitch
        (OVS) technology for NFV environments. Open vSwitch is a multilayer software switch licensed
        under the open source Apache 2 license.</p></section>

      <title>Ethernet Interface Types </title>
      <p>You can connect a VM directly to a physical interface using PCI passthrough or SR-IOV. You
        can choose either method by selecting <codeph>pci-sriov</codeph> or
          <codeph>pci-passthrough</codeph> as the network type when creating interfaces.
        <!--From WR Admin Guide.--></p>
      <p>When compared with a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface, a SR-IOV Ethernet interface: <ul
          id="ul_u1d_ffp_rt">
          <li>Provides benefits similar to those of a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface, including
            lower latency packet processing. </li>
          <li>Scales up more easily in a virtualized environment by providing multiple VFs that can
            be attached to multiple virtual machine interfaces.</li>
          <li>Shares the same limitations, including the lack of support for LAG, QoS, ACL, and live
            migration.</li>
          <li>Has the same requirements regarding the VLAN configuration of the access switches. </li>
          <li>Provides a similar configuration workflow.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Refer to the KVM Region Administrator Guide for more information on PCI Pass-through and
        SR-IOV.</p>
      <p><b>PCI Passthrough</b>. A passthrough Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet NIC on
        a compute node to which a virtual machine is granted direct access. This minimizes packet
        processing delays but at the same time demands special operational considerations. For all
        purposes, a PCI passthrough interface behaves as if it were physically attached to the
        virtual machine.</p>
      <p>Instructions for configuring SR-IOV are available after for installation, see <xref
          href="../Installation/CGH-2-install-pci-pass.dita#topic10581">Configuring
          PCI-Passthrough</xref></p>
      <p><b>SR-IOV</b>. A Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Ethernet interface is a physical
        PCI Ethernet NIC that implements hardware-based virtualization mechanisms to expose multiple
        virtual network interfaces that can be used by one or more virtual machines
        simultaneously.</p>
      <p>When compared with a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface, a SR-IOV Ethernet interface:
