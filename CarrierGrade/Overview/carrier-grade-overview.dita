      <p><b>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade </b> is a carrier grade OpenStack solution that
        enables CSPs to deploy applications on open source software platforms. HP Helion OpenStack
        Carrier Grade is based on OpenStack Kilo.</p>
      <p>Some key aspects include Linux host operating systems, server virtualization (KVM), network
        virtualization (vSwitch and SDN controllers), an installer and cloud lifecycle management
        framework, fault and performance management, and high-availability framework for the
        OpenStack control plane.</p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is based on HP Helion OpenStack 2.0 but with
        significantly enhanced and optimized functionality, availability, scale and performance to
        meet the needs of NFV cloud deployments.</p>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade includes following key components:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>OpenStack—core services including Horizon, Nova, Neutron, Cinder, Glance, Swift,
          Keystone, Ceilometer, and Heat. </li>
        <li>Compute node software package that includes: <ul>
            <li>Carrier-grade Linux (host operating system [OS] running on the compute nodes)</li>
            <li>Carrier-grade KVM (for virtualization of the compute node)</li>
            <li>Carrier-grade virtual switch, data plane development kit (DPDK)-enabled
              high-performance virtual switch</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>Management and middleware—composed of high-availability (HA) management; operations,
          administration, and maintenance (OAM); software image management; and fault and
          performance management</li>
        <li>Guest software development kit (SDK) for inclusion in the guest OS of the VNF for
          performance acceleration and improving the HA framework above and beyond standard
          VIMs.</li>
        <li>HP Helion Lifecycle Manager (HLM)—cloud installer and lifecycle manager.</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Service Overview</title>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is comprised of a number of services, including several
        OpenStack and HP Helion OpenStack services.</p>
      <p>For more information, see <xref href="carrier-grade.services-overview.dita">Services
          Overview</xref>.</p>

    <section><title>Virtual
        Switching</title><!--<p>Taken from http://blogs.windriver.com/wind_river_blog/2014/10/wanted-virtual-switching-without-compromise.html. Must rewrite</p>--><p>Virtual
        switching is a key function within data centers based on Software Defined Networking (SDN)
        as well as telecom infrastructures that leverages Network Functions Virtualization (NFV).
        </p><p>In the NFV scenario, for example, the virtual switch (vSwitch) is responsible for
        switching network traffic between the core network and the virtualized applications or
        Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that are running in Virtual Machines (VMs). </p><p>Based on
        your deployment model, you will use either:</p><b>HPE DCN Virtual Routing Switch (VRS)</b>.
      HPE DCN VRS is..<p><b> Accelerated vSwitch (AVS)</b>. AVS is integrated into the servers in
        the KVM region. AVS is an optimization of Open vSwitch (OVS) technology for NFV
        environments. Open vSwitch is a multilayer software switch licensed under the open source
        Apache 2 license.</p></section>
    
  <section>
      <title>Ethernet Interface Types </title>
      <p>You can connect a VM directly to a physical interface using PCI passthrough or SR-IOV. You
        can choose either method by selecting <codeph>pci-sriov</codeph> or
          <codeph>pci-passthrough</codeph> as the network type when creating interfaces.
        <!--From WR Admin Guide.--></p>
      <p><b>PCI Passthrough</b>. A passthrough Ethernet interface is a physical PCI Ethernet NIC on
        a compute node to which a virtual machine is granted direct access. This minimizes packet
        processing delays but at the same time demands special operational considerations. For all
        purposes, a PCI passthrough interface behaves as if it were physically attached to the
        virtual machine.</p>
      <p>Instructions for configuring SR-IOV are available after for installation, see <xref
          href="../Installation/CGH-2-install-pci-pass.dita#topic10581">Configuring
          PCI-Passthrough</xref></p>
      <p><b>SR-IOV</b>. A Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) Ethernet interface is a physical
        PCI Ethernet NIC that implements hardware-based virtualization mechanisms to expose multiple
        virtual network interfaces that can be used by one or more virtual machines
        simultaneously.</p>
      <p>When compared with a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface, a SR-IOV Ethernet interface:
          <!--From WR admin--><ul id="ul_b3l_y2r_5t">
          <li>Provides benefits similar to those of a PCI Passthtrough Ethernet interface, including
            lower latency packet processing.</li>
          <li>Scales up more easily in a virtualized environment by providing multiple Virtual
            Functions (VF) that can be attached to multiple virtual machine interfaces.</li>
          <li>Shares the same limitations, including the lack of support for LAG, QoS, ACL, and live
            migration.</li>
          <li>Has the same requirements regarding the VLAN configuration of the access
            switches.</li>
          <li>Provides a similar configuration workflow when used on HP Helion OpenStack Carrier
            Grade.</li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Instructions for configuring SR-IOV are available after for installation, see <xref

      <title>Backup and Restore</title>
      <p>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade includes a backup and restore application called Attis
        which you can use to backup and restore essential system files and components of the non-KVM
        cloud. Attis is automatically installed on each of the controller nodes in the non-KVM
        region. For more information, see <xref
          href="../OperationsGuide/Backup/CGH-2-backup-restore.dita#topic10581">Backup and Restore
          Configuration Files and MySQL Clusters</xref>.</p>
      <p>For information on backing up and restoring the KVM region, see the <xref

      <title>Centralized Logging</title>
      <p>The HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade Centralized Logging feature collects logs on a
        central system, rather than leaving the logs scattered across the network. The administrator
        can use a single Kibana interface to view log information in charts, graphs, tables,
        histograms, and other forms. For more information, see <xref

          Logging</xref>.</p>

    <section><title>Installation Options</title>HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade has four
      deployment models, depending on your system configuration. .<p>You can find more information
        on the deployment options in the <xref

          Overview</xref>.</p></section>
<section><title>External storage</title>
  <p>You can integrate either HPE Storevirtual (VSA) or HP
    StoreServ (3PAR) storage in the KVM region.</p><ul id="ul_il4_qfp_rt">
      <li>With HPE StoreVirtual VSA storage <p>HPE StoreVirtual VSA software is a Virtual Storage
        Appliance that provides the complete array functionality on top of a Linux KVM
        environment without external hardware. VSA eliminates the need for external shared
        storage required to implement Block Storage features.</p></li>
      <li>With HPE StoreServ (3PAR) storage <p>HPE 3PAR StoreServ is a storage array that supports
        Fibre Channel (FC) as well as iSCSI protocol.</p></li>
    </ul><p>You must install 3PAR or VSA before starting the HP Helion OpenStack installation and
      are independent of HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade. </p>
