<p>When a <xref href="../Networks/carrier-grade.dashboard.network.create.dita" >network is created</xref>, a subnet (short for <i>subnetwork</i>) can be assigned upon creation. However, you might need to add a subnet to a network at a later time.</p>
<p>A subnet is a logically visible subdivision of a network. A subnet enables you to group instances logically, while maintaining a single network address to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>An admin user can create and delete subnets as needed.</p>
<codeblock>
  <codeph>**Note:** Before you delete a subnet, you must first [delete all ports](/helion/commercial/carrier/dashboard/managing/network/ports/) associated with the subnet.

</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <b>Networks</b> link on the <b>Admin</b> dashboard <b>System</b> panel.</p>

<p>The network(s) in the domain appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the name of the network you want to work with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <b>Network Detail</b> page click <b>Create Subnet</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <b>Subnet</b> tab of the <b>Create Network</b> screen:</p>

<p>a. Enter the subnet name.</p>

<p>b. Enter a network address range for the subnet in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) format in the <b>Network Address</b> field, for example: 192.168.0.0/24.</p>

<p>c. Select IPv4 or IPv6, as appropriate, in the IP Version field.</p>

<p>d. Enter a gateway IP address from the subnet or leave the <b>Gateway IP</b> field blank to use the default value for the gateway IP address; for example, 192.168.0.1 for 192.168.0.0/24.</p>

<p>e. Leave <b>Disable Gateway</b> clear to enable the default gateway for this network, or select <b>Disable Gateway</b> to create the network with no default gateway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Subnet Details tab:</p>

<p>a Clear the <b>Enable DHCP</b> option, as needed, to not use the network as a DCHP. DHCP is enabled by default. If enabled, the subnet will serve as your DHCP server. Instances associated with the subnet will be assigned an IP address from this pool.</p>

<p>b. Optionally, enter the starting and ending IP addresses you want for your DHCP allocation pool in the <b>Allocation Pools</b> field, in the format IP<i>ADDR,IP</i>ADDR. For example: 192.168.1.10,192.168.1.120. By deafult, the server has an application pool starting with 10.0.0.0/24.</p>

<p>c. Optionally, enter the IP Address of your subnet in the <b>DNS Name Servers</b> field. If blank, your subnet will default to using HP's internal DNS which uses DNSMASQ.</p>

<p>d. Optionally, enter the Destination CIDR and Next Hop for your subnet in the <b>Host Routes</b> field to create host routes.</p>
