        <p>MAC addresses for virtual network interfaces on virtual machines are dynamically allocated by
   the system. For most scenarios, the assigned MAC addresses are expected to be used on all
   outgoing packets from the virtual machine instances. However, there are scenarios where the
   source MAC address is not expected to match the original assignment, such as when a L2 switch is
   implemented internally on the virtual machine.</p>
        <p>By default, the AVS on compute nodes accepts any source MAC address on the attached virtual
   network interfaces. However, it can be configured to filter out all incoming packets with
   non-system-generated source MAC address, if required. When evaluating the use of the filtering
   capability, you must consider the following:</p>
        <ul id="ul_rzm_jtt_m4">
            <li>
                <p>Source MAC address filtering can be enabled and disabled by the administrator user only, not
     by tenants.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Filtering is enabled on a per-tenant basis only. Higher granularity, such as per-instance
     filtering, is not supported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When enabled, source MAC address filtering applies to all new virtual interfaces created by
     the Neutron service. Address filtering is not active on virtual interfaces created before
     filtering is enabled.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use the following command to enable source MAC address filtering:</p>
        <codeblock>~(keystone_admin)$ neutron setting-update --tenant-id=&lt;TENANTID&gt; \
--mac-filtering={True|False}</codeblock>
        <p>Filtering can be enabled or disabled from the web management interface.
