            <p>During software installation, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade is configured with an
                OAM network subnet and related IP addresses. You can change these addresses using
                the web administration interface or the CLI.</p>
            <note id="note_N1002F_N1002B_N1001D_N10001" type="caution">
                <p>Access to the OAM network is interrupted during this procedure. When a swact is
                    performed on the controllers, the newly active controller uses the changed OAM
                    IP addresses. The existing OAM IP addresses are no longer valid, and you must
                    use the new OAM IP addresses to reconnect to the controller. Changes to external
                    OAM access routing settings may also be required. In addition, VNC console
                    access to compute-node hosts is interrupted until the hosts are locked and
                    unlocked.</p>
            </note>
        
        
            <p>Before changing the OAM IP configuration, review the Fault Management
                page and ensure that any existing system alarms are cleared.</p>

                        <b>System Configuration</b> pane.
                
                    <p>The <b>System Configuration</b>
                        pane is available from the <b>System

                    <p>The <b>OAM IP</b> page
                        appears, showing the currently defined OAM network configuration.</p>

                                <p>After the swact, HP Helion OpenStack Carrier Grade begins using
                                    the new OAM network configuration. If you have changed the OAM
                                    subnet or the OAM floating IP address, the current web session
                                    is terminated. To continue using the web administration

                    <p>If any alarms are present, clear them by locking and

                        one minute. If other system configuration operations are pending for the
                        host, allow more time for the alarms to be cleared.</p>
